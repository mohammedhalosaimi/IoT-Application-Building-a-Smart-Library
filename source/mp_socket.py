        """
        Server connetion is to start a TCP socket on the Master Pi (server) so that all reception PIs can connect to the server.
        On setting up the connection, server listens to the connection requests and the coming messages.
        This message will be the logged in user name which will be used for book borrowing purpose.
        When the user selects logout from the library menu, the server will send "logout" message to RP
        and RP is required to logout the user. The server stands by until another user logs in
